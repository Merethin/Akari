# NS Happenings Reference

This is a list of unique NS happening lines and the regexes to match them (in Rust syntax), which tries its best to be exhaustive (please let me know if you encounter a happening line that isn't referenced/matched here!).

Since the presence of ending periods is inconsistent between the Happenings API and SSE events (and within SSE as well - some events have them, others do not!), these regex expressions assume that any ending periods have been stripped out.

Each happening has a descriptive label (in bold), followed by an identifier/category name of up to 8 characters. You are free to use whichever identifying system you want in your own project - these identifiers are just the ones Akari uses, and which client programs should expect.

Additionally, these expressions have instructions on how to extract certain bits of commonly used data from the regex. Below is a "parsed event structure" with certain fields, and after each regex pattern there is a short list of what fields to fill with which captured data.

SSE provides additional data on the context in which an event happens, notably with the `region:` bucket(s) in the "buckets" array. This lets you know which region an event occurred in even if the region is not explicitly mentioned in the happening line. Therefore, a few events mention "from `region:` bucket" so that you can get that data from there if it is present, or apply some fallback if not (Akari uses the special "[unknown]" region name, which is not a valid NS region name and can be filtered, in this case).

# Event structure

```
pub struct Event {
   event_id: u64, # The ID of the event. Has to be unique.
   timestamp: u64, # The UNIX integer timestamp of the event. Formatted as "TIMESTAMP" in Happenings.
   line: String, # The happening line directly from NS, with ending periods removed.
   actor: Option<String>, # The nation triggering this event, i.e. performing an action.
   receptor: Option<String>, # If there is one, the nation receiving the event (ex. being endorsed).
   origin: Option<String>, # The region where this event was originated.
   destination: Option<String>, # If this event includes several regions, the region which receives the event (receiving an embassy request, nation moving to that region).
   category: String, # A specific event category processed from the happening line.
   data: Vec<String>, # Values specific to the event, depending on the category (RMB post id, dispatch name, issue result)
}
```

# Generic

## no bucket (bucket: all)

These are weird. Don't show up in region feeds, but show up in nation feeds (Only when All is selected, don't match any other category). The Happenings API replicates the same behavior. SSE: not tested.

# System events

These are not emitted by NationStates but by Akari itself.

This section has no use if you're simply looking at this document to use the regex patterns for your own project, but will be useful if you're building something that depends on Akari.

These events always have an event ID of -1.

**Connection to NationStates established / reestablished (conninit)**

`^System: Connection to NationStates initialized / resumed$`

**Connection to NationStates lost (conndrop)**

`^System: Connection to NationStates lost$`

**Missed events from NationStates (connmiss)**

`^System: ([0-9]+) NationStates events missed \(from ([0-9]+) to ([0-9]+)\)$`
- data: first group (number of events missed), second group (last event ID received before the missed events), third group (first event ID received after the missed events)

Typically emitted just after a `conninit` event when the connection has been successfully reestablished after being lost for a period of time.

The regex pattern is included for convenience; you shouldn't need it as Akari already gives you the parsed fields.

## Utility

In most cases, when a `conndrop` event occurs, the connection will only be down for a minute or so - a sporadic SSE failure will lead to Akari dropping the connection, attempting to reconnect after 60 seconds and successfully doing so.

However, in some cases (if the connection limit is reached, or the SSE server / API is down for an extended period of time, or even NS itself), the disconnection period may persist for longer. In those cases, applications may want to switch to an alternative method of fetching events when the `conndrop` event is received (for example, a recruiting program using Akari for nation founds temporarily switching to the `newnationdetails` API) until the connection is resumed (which will send a `conninit` event).

If an application wants to process every single happening of a given kind, it may find it useful to catch the `connmiss` event in order to fetch the missing events fron the happenings API directly (In the future, Akari may optionally do this itself for certain output sources).
